# Starting Checklist

## Basic Setup

- [/] Add headers
- [/] Run Factory Tests
- [x] Setup IDEs
- [x] Loading basic libraries for hardware
- [/] Run Blink program

## Basic Screen Setup

- [x] Ensure all required libraries are installed (lvgl and more)
	- [x] [Getting Started with Seeed Studio Round Display for XIAO](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/get_start_round_display/#step-3-configure-the-arduino-ide-for-the-xiao-you-are-using)
		> [!seealso]+ Additional Info
		> Information on [using LVGL and TFT](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/using_lvgl_and_tft_on_round_display#common-interfaces-for-lvgl-library)
		> [ZIP file for latest lvgl](https://github.com/lvgl/lvgl/archive/refs/heads/master.zip)
		> 
		> Note: Libraries can also be found in Library Manager.
		
	- [x] Make sure to move the `lv_conf.h` file from `libraries/Seeed_Arduino_Round_display` is copied to `libraries`

## Battery Functions

- [/] Wire up battery
- [/] Test running on battery
- [ ] Test charging
- [ ] Test voltage measuring

> [!tip]+ Existing Measuring Technique
> For the design of the Round Display, we used the`A0`/`D0` pins on the XIAO to connect to the circuitry of the on-board battery. The remaining battery charge can be obtained by reading the analog value of this pin.
